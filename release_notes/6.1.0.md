# Jasmine Core 6.1.0 Release Notes

## Changes to supported environments

* Safari 16 and 17 are no longer supported. Although jasmine-core may still work
  in those versions, we no longer have a reliable way to test them and won't try
  to maintain compatibility with them in future releases.

## New features

* Report the underlying errors that make up an `AggregateError`.
    * Merges [#2093](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/pull/2093) from @puglyfe
    * Fixes [#2063](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/issues/2063)

## Documentation improvements

* Fix default MAX_PRETTY_PRINT_CHARS in JsDoc.
    * Merges [#2091](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/pull/2091) from @HolgerJeromin

\* Evergreen browser. Each version of Jasmine is tested against the latest
version available at release time.<br>
\** Supported on a best-effort basis. Support for these versions may be dropped
if it becomes impractical, and bugs affecting only these versions may not be
treated as release blockers.
